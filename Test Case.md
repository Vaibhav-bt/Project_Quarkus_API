## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a CRUD API (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using the Quarkus Java framework that interacts with a MySQL database and is set up with an Nginx load balancer for scalability and high availability.

**Example:**
Imagine you are building a User Management System for a small company. They want a backend API that allows their team to manage employee information. They can create, update, delete, and read employee information using this API.
